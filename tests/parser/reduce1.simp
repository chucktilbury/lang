;   This test demonstrates the shift/reduce and the reduce/reduce conflict in
;   parser. The problem is that the compound_name and the compound_reference
;   non-terminals conflict. The only difference between them is that the
;   compound_reference can accept syntax for an array reference and/or a
;   function reference and the compound_name non-terminal does not.
